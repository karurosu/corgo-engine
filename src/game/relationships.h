/** 
 * How to define a relationship:
 * 
 * 1. Add the relationship to the relationship description macro below:
 * 
 *   #define CE_RELATIONSHIP_DESC_GAME(X) \
 *    X(CE_RELATIONSHIP_NAME)
 * 
 * 2. Use the relationship in your game systems or components as needed.
 *   See docs for details on defining and using relationships.
 * 
 *  Tips:
 *  - Don't forget the backslash at the end of the line when adding new relationships.
 *  - Add relationships in pairs with their reciprocal (e.g., parent-child).
